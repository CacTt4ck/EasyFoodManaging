*   **Docker Ready**: Simplified deployment with a pre-configured database via Docker Compose.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Java 21
*   **Framework**: Spring Boot (Web, Data JPA)
*   **Database**: PostgreSQL
*   **Build Tool**: Gradle
*   **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## 📋 Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you only need:

*   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
*   Git.

*Note: You do not need to install Java or PostgreSQL on your machine manually; Docker handles everything.*

## 🏁 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get the application running in minutes:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/EasyFoodManaging.git
cd EasyFoodManaging
```

### 2. Configuration (Optional)
The project comes with a default file at the root. You can modify it if you wish to change the database credentials or the application port. `.env`
``` properties
# Example .env content
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
POSTGRES_DB=easyfooddb
APP_PORT=8080
```

### 3. Run the application
Use Docker Compose to build the image and start both the database and the backend simultaneously:
``` bash
docker compose up --build
```

Once the startup is complete, the application will be accessible at: http://localhost:8080 (or the port defined in your .env file).

## 🧪 API Usage
The application exposes several REST endpoints. Here are a few examples (check your controllers for exact paths):
Ingredients: GET /api/ingredients
Recipes: GET /api/recipes
Tip: Use Postman or curl to test the endpoints.
